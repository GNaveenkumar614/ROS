**Automating the Turtle Simulation to Draw Shapes 🔺**
Introduction to Shape Drawing: Briefly explain the importance of automation in simulations and how it can be applied to drawing shapes. 📐

**Creating a Package:**

Describe the steps to create a ROS package that will automate the turtle to draw shapes. 📦
Include details on the necessary files and directories that need to be created within the package.📁

**Shape Functions:**

Explain how to write functions for each shape: Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Pentagon, and Hexagon. 🔵🔺
For each shape, provide a brief explanation of the logic behind the drawing process (e.g., how many sides, angles, etc.). 📏
